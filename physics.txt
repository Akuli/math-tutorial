# Physics Stuff

This is mostly a math tutorial, but the math is not useless or isolated from
the real world in any way. In this chapter we'll look into a bunch of ways to
use math things for calculating more concrete stuff in the real world.

    This chapter assumes that you know [derivatives](derivatives.html) and
    [integrals](integrals.html).

I'll use [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
in this chapter, so instead of inches and pounds there will be centimeters and
kilograms. If you live in a country that doesn't use SI units much, have a look
at this conversion table of stuff I have used in this chapter:

<table>
<tr><th>Name of SI unit</th><th>Example value</th><th>Example value in non-SI units<sup>*</sup></th></tr>
<tr><td>kilogram</td><td>80 kg</td><td>180 lbs</td></tr>
<tr><td>metre</td><td>9.81 m</td><td>32 feet</td></tr>
<tr><td>centimetre, $1\rm{cm}=\frac{1}{100}\rm{m}$</td><td>10 cm</td><td>4 inches</td></tr>
</table>

## Basic Stuff

Here's a list of things I'll use in this tutorial:

* Mass is usually denoted with $m$, and it's in kilograms.

* Time is almost always denoted with $t$ and measured with seconds.

* Distances are often denoted with e.g. $x$ or $y$. The SI unit of distances is
  metre.

* Velocity means how fast you are moving; in other words, it's the derivative
  of your location with respect to time:

indent:
    math:
        v = \frac{dx}{dt}

    The unit of velocity is $\rm{m}/\rm{s}$ because $dx$ is conceptually a tiny
    distance (metres) and $dt$ is a tiny time interval (seconds).

* Acceleration is the changing rate of the velocity. If it's positive, your
  velocity is getting bigger.

indent:
    math:
        a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}

    The $d^2$ notation means the derivative of the derivative of $x$; we take
    the derivative two times. It "works" like this:

    math:
        a = \frac{d\frac{dx}{dt}}{dt} \
        \mathop{=}^{\red ?}\frac{d \cdot dx}{dt \cdot dt} \
        \mathop{=}^{\red ?}\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}

    This makes no sense because $dx$ doesn't mean $d$ times $x$; it means the
    change of $x$. However, it's just notation, and the
    $\frac{d}{dt}x = \frac{dx}{dt}$ we are more used to doesn't make sense
    either.

    It can be handy to think of $x$, $v$ and $a$ as functions of the time and
    write $x(t)$ instead of plain $x$, and this lets us use the usual $'$
    notation:

    math:
        v(t) &= x'(t)
        a(t) &= x''(t)

    Velocity is metres per second, so acceleration is metres per second per
    second, or $\frac{\rm{m}/\rm{s}}{\rm s} = \rm{m}/\rm{s}^2$. For example,
    $2\rm m/\rm{s}^2=\frac{2\rm m/\rm s}{\rm s}$ means that the velocity
    increases by $2\rm m/\rm s$ every second.

This is already enough stuff for calculating something fun:

## Example: Feather and Hammer

Here's a famous
experiment:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5C5_dOEyAfk"></iframe>

As you can see, the acceleration caused by gravity does not depend on the mass
or shape of the object if there's no air resistance. Let's try to calculate
what that acceleration is.

Let's call the acceleration $g$. It's a constant, so we can find the speed
$v(t)$ easily. We'll choose this so that positive $v$ means going down; this
way we can work with positive numbers and keep everything nice and simple.

math:
    v(t) = \int g\ dt = gt+C_1

At $t=0$ the hammer and feather were just about to be dropped, and their
velocity was still $0$:

math:
    v(0) &= 0
    g \cdot 0 + C_1 &= 0
    C_1 &= 0
    v(t) &= gt

We can integrate again to find the height at time $t$. Let's call that $y(t)$
so that more $y$ means down.

math:
    y(t) &= \int v(t)\ dt = \int gt\ dt = \frac 1 2 gt^2 + C_2

The initial height of the objects seems to be about $1.5\rm m$, and dropping
them took about one second:

math:
    y(1\rm s)-y(0\rm s) &= 1.5\rm m
    \Bigl(\frac 1 2 g(1\rm s)^2 + \rcancel{C_2}\Bigr) - \Bigl(\frac 1 2 g\cdot0^2 + \rcancel{C_2}\Bigr) &= 1.5 \rm m
    \frac 1 2 g(1\rm s)^2 &= 1.5 \rm m
    g &= 2 \cdot \frac{1.5 \rm m}{(1\rm s)^2} = 1.5 \rm m/\rm{s}^2

A quick search for "moon gravity" gives $1.625 \rm m/\rm{s}^2$, and our thing
is not too bad considering the horribly inaccurate $1.5\rm m$ and $1\rm s$ we
calculated it from. A similar experiment on Earth would yield
$g\approx9.81 \rm m/\rm{s}^2$, and that's a $g$ value we'll use in most of our
other examples.

graybox: Exercise
    Try to get more accurate dropping time and distance from the video and
    calculate this stuff again. Can you get closer to $1.625 \rm m/\rm{s}^2$?

## Newton's Second Law

Here's Newton's second law, written in a mathy way:

math:
    \Sigma F = ma

Here $\Sigma$ means sum, and $\Sigma F$ is the sum of all forces that are
pushing a mass and causing it an acceleration. In our previous example, there
was only one force, the gravity $G$:

math:
    \green{\Sigma F} = m\blue{a}
    \green{G} = m\blue{g}

In fact, the force caused by gravity is always $mg$. For example, let's
calculate the force that gravity pulls a person of weight 80kg down at:

math:
    G = mg = 80\rm{kg} \cdot 9.81\rm m/\rm{s}^2 \approx 784\rm{kgm}/\rm{s}^2 = 784 \rm N

Here the $\rm N$ unit is 1 newton, defined so that
$1\rm N = \frac{1\rm{kg} \cdot 1\rm m}{(1\rm s)^2}$.

If you're sitting in front of your computer, gravity is pulling you down, but
your acceleration is zero because you don't fall through your chair. Let's
figure out why:

math:
    \Sigma F = ma = m \cdot 0 = 0

This means that $\Sigma F \ne G$ because $G \ne 0$; instead $\Sigma F = G + M$
where $M$ is some kind of Mystery force that we'll try to explain.

math:
    \Sigma F &= 0
    G + M &= 0
    M &= -G

This mystery force is your chair holding up your butt, and it has a minus sign
in the front because it goes to the opposite direction compared to gravity.
That's why they cancel out nicely and you don't accelerate anywhere.

Newton's first and third law are very closely related to Newton's second law.
For example, the first law is a special case of the second law: it says that a
mass stays in place or moves smoothly ($a=0$) if no forces apply to it
($\Sigma F = 0$).
