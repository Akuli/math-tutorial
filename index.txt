# Math for Programmers

This tutorial contains practical math for programmers who want to get stuff
done, as well as explanation chapters for those who get interested in how the
math works.

Start by reading [the basics page](basics.html).

If you're a game developer or you do something else with xy coordinate things,
I recommend reading these:

<ul>
<li>[Geometry and trigonometry tutorial](geometry-and-trig.html)</li>
<li>[Derivative tutorial](derivatives.html)</li>
<li>[Integral tutorial](integrals.html)</li>
</ul>

If you're working with something that uses colors, [this chapter](#numbertheory.html)
explains how ``#ff0000`` is red.

Currently the tutorial also contains a few [explanations](explanations.html)
for people who get interested in why the math works.
