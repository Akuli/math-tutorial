# Math for Programmers

Math looks like a mess of symbols if you aren't familiar with it, but the
purpose of symbols and concepts is to decrease annoying repetition. For example,
it's much easier to write $2+3$ than "the number of apples you get if I give you
two apples and John gives you three apples". The math itself is independent from
everything and mathematicians don't make it up, they just discover things about
how numbers behave in different cases.

This tutorial contains practical math for programmers who want to get stuff
done, but also math that is really fun on its own even though most people won't
find it practical. I assume that you have some experience with programming, but
you'll probably understand most of this tutorial without programming skills.

Start by opening [the basics page](basics.html) and keep it open while you read
the tutorial. There's nothing wrong with looking up things from it as you go.

If you came here because you want to calculate some specific thing, go to [the
summary page](summary.html) to get a nice and concise list of things that are
shown in this tutorial.

If you don't know what to start with I recommend [the derivative
tutorial](derivatives.html). Derivatives are a nice example of why I like math;
calculations that seem like they will be complicated turn out to be doable in
the end, and we can develop a bunch of handy rules to make things even easier.
After that, if you got interested in the math itself, you have a few options:

* You can [read more about derivatives](more-derivatives.html).
* You can continue to [the integral tutorial](integrals.html) to learn about a
  surprising way to use derivatives.
* You can read stuff in the mind-blowing section at right. Be sure to learn all
  the required skills listed in the beginning of each chapter; otherwise you'll
  miss the mind-blowiness by not understanding everything. Note that I'm not
  responsible for exploding brains.
