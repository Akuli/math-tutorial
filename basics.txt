# The Basics

This tutorial assumes that you know most of these things. If you don't, that's
not a problem at all and you can just **keep this page open** while you read
other chapters.

## Variables

Mathematicians use single-letter variable names because math was
originally written on paper by hand and writing long things by hand
sucks. There are a few exceptions though; for example, $\sin$ and $\cos$
are functions with 3-letter names. (I don't assume that you know
anything else about $\sin$ and $\cos$ yet.) If they would be called $s$
and $c$ instead it would be confusing to have a variable named $s$ or
$c$, so they are written a bit more verbosely.

(constants)
A variable is considered to be a *constant* if its value doesn't depend
on $x$ (or sometimes some other variable we're talking about). For
example, $5$ and $-12$ are constants, but $x+1$ is not a constant
because $x+1$ gets different values depending on what $x$ is.

## Equality and stuff

I'm quite sure you know or you can guess what $a=b$, $a \ne b$, $a>b$,
$a \ge b$, $a < b$, $a \le b$ and $a \approx b$ mean so I won't explain
those.


## +, -

Be careful when you have a minus in front of parentheses, e.g. $-(1+2)=-1-2$
and $-(1-2)=-1+2$. So, two minus signs cancel out each other, like $-(-2)=2$.

If we have something like $a+b+c-b$ we know that's just $a+c$ because we're
adding $b$ and then we're taking it away. Later you'll notice that we end up
with this $x+y-x$ pattern surprisingly often and things become nice and simple.

In general, you can move things around like this:

math: a+b-c = a-c+b = -c+a+b = ...

You get the idea: we can put $+a$, $+b$ and $-c$ to any order we want, and for
convenience, we usually write e.g. $a+b$ instead of $+a+b$.


## *, /

In this tutorial, ``a/b`` is written as $a/b$ or $\frac a b$, and ``a*b`` is
written as $a \cdot b$ or simply $ab$.

Some handy stuff:

math:
    0a &= 0
    1a &= a
    (-1)a &= -a
    \frac a 1 &= a
    ab &= ba
    -(a-b) &= b-a
    (a+b)c &= ac+bc
    (a-b)c &= ac-bc
    \frac{a+b}{c} &= \frac a c + \frac b c
    \frac{a-b}{c} &= \frac a c - \frac b c
    \frac{\left( \frac a b \right)}{c} &= \frac{a}{bc}

You can use these rules left-to-right or right-to-left. For example, if you
want to calculate $(1 + 2) \cdot 3$ you know you could also do
$1 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3$, but you can also calculate $1 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3$
like $(1 + 2) \cdot 3$.

Note that there is **no** $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b+c}=\frac a b + \frac a c$
rule; that doesn't work. This also applies to $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b-c}$.

It's often best to look at which numbers are below a division line and which
aren't. For example, if we have $\frac 1 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac 4 5$ we know
that's $\frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 5}$ because 2 and 5 were below the
lines but other numbers weren't. If something is below *two* division lines,
then you can move it to top, like $\displaystyle\frac{a}{\ \frac b c\ } = \frac{ac}{b}$.

If both the top and bottom are being multiplied by something you can get rid of
that multiplier. For example:

math: \frac{x}{ax+bx} = \frac{1x}{(a+b)x} = \frac{1}{a+b}, x \ne 0

(zerodivision)
Remember that you cannot divide anything by zero. See
[Numberphile's awesome zero video](https://youtu.be/BRRolKTlF6Q) if you're
wondering why.

(negative-mul-div)
Negative numbers behave like this when multiplied and divided. Note how the two
-'s cancel out.

math: 2 \cdot (-2) = -(2 \cdot 2) = -4

math: (-2) \cdot (-2) = -(-(2 \cdot 2)) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4

math: \frac{-3}{-4} = \frac{(-1) \cdot 3}{(-1) \cdot 4} = \frac 3 4


## Absolute Value

The absolute value of $x$ is $|x|$ in math and something like ``abs(x)`` or
``Math.abs(x)`` in most programming languages. It's easiest to think of the
absolute value as stripping off the minus sign. For example, $|2| = 2$ and
$|-3| = 3$.


## Powers and Square Root

$x^y$ is ``x**y`` or ``pow(x, y)`` and $\sqrt x$ is ``sqrt(x)`` in most
programming languages.

math: x^5=x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x

math:
    x^a y^a = \underbrace{x \cdot ... \cdot x}_{a\text{ pcs}} \cdot \
              \underbrace{y \cdot ... \cdot y}_{a\text{ pcs}} \
            = \underbrace{(xy)(xy)...(xy)}_{a\text{ pcs}} \
            = (xy)^a

math:
    \frac{x^a}{y^a} \
  = \frac{\ \overbrace{x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot...\cdot x}^{a\text{ pcs}}\ } \
         {\ \underbrace{y\cdot y\cdot y\cdot...\cdot y}_{a\text{ pcs}}\ } \
  = \underbrace{\frac x y \cdot \frac x y \cdot ... \cdot \frac x y}_{a\text{ pcs}} \
  = \left( \frac x y \right)^a

math:
   x^{a+b}  = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot... \cdot x}_{a+b\text{ pcs}} \
            = \underbrace{x \cdot...\cdot x}_{a\text{ pcs}} \cdot \
              \underbrace{x \cdot...\cdot x}_{b\text{ pcs}} \
            = x^a x^b

math:
   (x^a)^b = \underbrace{\overbrace{x^a}^{x\cdot...\cdot x,\ a\text{ pcs}} \
              \cdot\ \ x^a\ \cdot ... \cdot x^a}_{b\text{ pcs}} \
           = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot...\cdot x}_{a\cdot b\ \text{pcs}} \
           = x^{ab}

math: (-x)^2 = x^2

math: x^0 = 1

math: \sqrt x = x^\frac 1 2

math: \sqrt a \sqrt b = \sqrt{ab}

math: (\sqrt x\ )^2 = x

math: \sqrt{x^2} = |x|

(square-negative-cancel)
The $(-x)^2=x^2$ rule probably seems confusing, but an example should make it
clear:

math:
    (-2)^2 = (-2)(-2) = -(-(2 \cdot 2)) = 2 \cdot 2 = 2^2

This also means that $x^2$ is never negative. See [the $y=x^2$
graph](graphs.html#parabolas).

If you're wondering why anything to the power of 0 is 1, you can do e.g.
$x^2 = x^{0+2} = x^0 x^2$. The equation should be true with any $x$, so
$x^0$ must be 1 because $x^2 = 1 x^2$.

(negative-sqrt)
It's easiest to think of $\sqrt x$ as the non-negative number that is $x$ when
multiplied with itself. For example, 3 is not negative, so $\sqrt 9 = 3$
because $3 \cdot 3 = 9$. Similarly e.g. $\sqrt 4 = 2$, $\sqrt 1 = 1$ and
$\sqrt 0 = 0$. No number produces a negative number when multiplied with
itself, so you cannot do e.g. $\sqrt{-2}$.

You're probably wondering how the heck our $\sqrt{x^2}=|x|$ rule works. This
example should explain everything:

math: \sqrt{(-3)^2}=\sqrt{(-3)(-3)}=\sqrt{-(-(3 \cdot 3))}=\sqrt{3 \cdot 3}=\sqrt{3^2}


## Functions

Here's a typical math function:

math:
   f(x) &= 2x
   f(6) &= 2 \cdot 6 = 12

There is no special syntax for defining a function. All we have is the
equal sign, and when defining a function we just say that its value at x is
equal to something.

If you're familiar with a functional programming language like Haskell, then
you'll probably realize that the above math looks a lot like this Haskell
session:

code: haskell
   Prelude> let f x = 2*x
   Prelude> f 6
   12
   Prelude>

If you're feeling like WTF is this, here's a Python session that should make
everything clear.

code: python3
   >>> def f(x):
   ...     return 2*x
   ...
   >>> f(6)
   12

Quick note about ``f(x)`` versus ``f x``: if you define your own function
called $f$ or $g$ you should use $f(x)$, but you can do e.g. $\sin x$ or
$\cos x$ with some "special" functions for historical reasons. This tutorial
uses $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ everywhere because most programmers are familiar
with that.


## Equations

For example, if you know that $2x+1 = 9$ you can find $x$ like this:

math:
    2x+1 &= 9
    2x &= 8
    x &= 4

The idea here is that if $2x+1=9$ then $(2x+1)-1=9-1$; that is, $2x=8$. So you
can do pretty much anything to both sides of the $=$ and the equality will
still work. I started by substracting 1 from both sides and then I divided
everything by 2.

Normal limitations apply here; for example, if you have $2x=3x$ and you divide
by $x$ you get $2=3$ and it seems like no $x$ can satisfy the equation.
However, you cannot divide by $0$ and turns out that $x=0$ is a valid solution
because $2 \cdot 0 = 0$ and $3 \cdot 0 = 0$.

You can also apply most functions to both sides. For example, you can do this
with $\sqrt{\quad}$:

math:
    x^2 &= 4
    \sqrt{x^2} &= \sqrt 4
    |x| &= 2
    x=2\ & \text{or}\ x=-2

## Areas

If you are a programmer you'll probably understand areas best as the
number of pixels in a shape. For example, if you create a GUI program
that creates a 300 by 200 window, it contains $300 \cdot 200 = 60000$
pixels.

asymptote: float:left;
    size(5cm);
    real w=3, h=2;
    filldraw((0,0)--(0,h)--(w,h)--(w,0)--cycle, paleyellow);
    label((w/2,h/2), L="$A=ab$");
    label((w/2,0), L="$a$", align=S);
    label((w,h/2), L="$b$", align=E);

asymptote: float:left;
    size(9cm);
    real a=3, h=2, offset=1;
    filldraw((offset,h)--(0,0)--(a,0)--cycle, palegreen);
    draw((offset,0)--(offset,h), smalldashes, L="$h$", align=W);
    label((a/2,0), L="$a$", align=S);
    label((offset+(a-offset)/3,h/4), L="$A=\displaystyle\frac{ah}{2}$");

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

The yellow area is simple, but the triangle area is also easy to
understand. Let's draw a rectangle around the triangle like this:

asymptote:
    size(5cm);
    real a=3, h=2, offset=1;
    filldraw((offset,h)--(0,0)--(a,0)--cycle, palegreen);
    label((a/2,0), L="$a$", align=S);
    draw((offset,0)--(offset,h), smalldashes);
    draw((0,0)--(0,h), smalldashes, L="$h$", align=W);
    draw((0,h)--(a,h)--(a,0), smalldashes);

Now you can see that the triangle splits both pieces of the rectangle in
half, so the triangle area must be half of the rectangle area $ah$.

## Volumes

A volume is really the same thing as an area, but for 3D things. If our
300 by 200 window was 50 pixels deep, then $300 \cdot 200 \cdot 50 = 3000000$
pixels would fit inside it.

asymptote3d: float:left;
    size(7cm);

    real a=2, b=3, c=4;
    currentprojection = perspective(camera=(-5a,-1b,2c), up=Z);

    draw(scale(a,b,c)*unitcube, yellow+opacity(0.6));
    label((a/2,0,0), L="$a$", align=SE);
    label((0,b/2,0), L="$b$", align=S);
    label((0,b,c/2), L="$c$", align=W);
    label((a/2,b/2,c/2), L="$V=abc$");

asymptote3d: float:left;
    size(7cm);

    real r1=2, r2=3, h=4;
    currentprojection = perspective(camera=(2h,1.5h,2h), up=Z);

    draw(scale(r1,r2,1)*surface(unitcircle3), mediumblue+opacity(0.7));
    draw(scale(r1,r2,h)*unitcylinder, mediumblue+opacity(0.5));
    draw(shift(0,0,h)*scale(r1,r2,1)*surface(unitcircle3), yellow+opacity(0.8));
    label((0,0,h/2), L="$V=Ah$");
    label((1,1,h), L="$A$", align=N);

    draw(path3(brace((r2,h),(r2,0)), YZplane), L="$h$", align=E);

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

The $V=abc$ thing is actually just a special case of the $V=Ah$
cylinder. The shape of the cylinder's base can be anything, and in the
$abc$ thing the base area is $ab$ and the height is $c$.
