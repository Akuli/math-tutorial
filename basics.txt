# The Basics

This tutorial assumes that you know most of these things. If you don't, that's
not a problem at all and you can just keep the basics page open while you read
other chapters.

## Variable Names

Mathematicians use single-letter variable names because math was
originally written on paper by hand and writing long things by hand
sucks. There are a few exceptions though; for example, $\sin$ and $\cos$
are functions with 3-letter names. If they would be called $s$ and $c$
instead it would be confusing to have a variable named $s$ or $c$, so
they are written a bit more verbosely.

## Equality and stuff

I'm quite sure you know or you can guess what $a=b$, $a>b$, $a \ge b$, $a < b$
and $a \le b$ mean so I won't explain those. The equivalent of ``a != b`` in
programming is $a \ne b$ in math. $a \approx b$ means that $a$ and $b$ are
close to each other, but it doesn't contain any information about *how* close
to each other the values are.


## +, -

Be careful when you have a minus in front of parentheses, e.g. $-(1+2)=-1-2$.

If we have something like $a+b+c-b$ we know that's just $a+c$ because we're
adding $b$ and then we're taking it away. Later you'll notice that we end up
with this $x+y-x$ pattern surprisingly often and things become nice and simple.

In general, you can move things around like this:

math: a+b-c = a-c+b = -c+a+b = ...

You get the idea: we can put $+a$, $+b$ and $-c$ to any order we want, and for
convenience, we usually write e.g. $a+b$ instead of $+a+b$.


## *, /

In this tutorial, ``a/b`` is written as $a/b$ or $\frac a b$, and ``a*b`` is
written as $a \cdot b$ or simply $ab$.

Some handy stuff:

comment: these take up a lot of space... is it possible to fix this?

math: 0a = 0

math: 1a = a

math: \frac{a}{1} = a

math: ab = ba

math: (a+b)c = ac+bc

math: (a-b)c = ac-bc

math: \frac{a+b}{c} = \frac a c + \frac b c

math: \frac{a-b}{c} = \frac a c - \frac b c

math: \frac{\left( \frac a b \right)}{c} = \frac{a/b}{c} = \frac{a}{bc}

You can use these rules left-to-right or right-to-left. For example, if you
want to calculate $(1 + 2) \cdot 3$ you know you could also do
$1 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3$, but you can also calculate $1 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3$
like $(1 + 2) \cdot 3$.

Note that there is **no** $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b+c}=\frac a b + \frac a c$
rule; that doesn't work. This also applies to $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b-c}$.

It's often best to look at which numbers are below a division line and which
aren't. For example, if we have $\frac 1 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac 4 5$ we know
that's $\frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 5}$ because 2 and 5 were below the
lines but other numbers weren't.

If both the top and bottom are being multiplied by something you can get rid of
that multiplier. For example:

math: \frac{x}{ax+bx} = \frac{1x}{(a+b)x} = \frac{1}{a+b}, x \ne 0

(zerodivision)
Remember that you cannot divide anything by zero. See
[Numberphile's awesome zero video](https://youtu.be/BRRolKTlF6Q) if you're
wondering why.

(negative-mul-div)
Negative numbers behave like this when multiplied and divided. Note how the two
-'s cancel out.

math: 2 \cdot (-2) = -(2 \cdot 2) = -4

math: (-2) \cdot (-2) = -(-(2 \cdot 2)) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4

math: \frac{-3}{-4} = \frac{(-1) \cdot 3}{(-1) \cdot 4} = \frac 3 4


## Absolute Value

The absolute value of $x$ is $|x|$ in math and something like ``abs(x)`` or
``Math.abs(x)`` in most programming languages. It's easiest to think of the
absolute value as stripping off the minus sign. For example, $|2| = 2$ and
$|-3| = 3$.


## Powers and Square Root

$x^y$ is ``x**y`` or ``pow(x, y)`` and $\sqrt x$ is ``sqrt(x)`` in most
programming languages.

math: x^5=x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x

math:
    x^a y^a = \underbrace{x \cdot ... \cdot x}_{a\text{ pcs}} \cdot
              \underbrace{y \cdot ... \cdot y}_{a\text{ pcs}}
            = \underbrace{(xy)(xy)...(xy)}_{a\text{ pcs}}
            = (xy)^a

math:
    \frac{x^a}{y^a}
  = \frac{\ \overbrace{x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot...\cdot x}^{a\text{ pcs}}\ }
         {\ \underbrace{y\cdot y\cdot y\cdot...\cdot y}_{a\text{ pcs}}\ }
  = \underbrace{\frac x y \cdot \frac x y \cdot ... \cdot \frac x y}_{
        a\text{ pcs}}
  = \left( \frac x y \right)^a

math:
   x^{a+b}  = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot... \cdot x}_{a+b\text{ pcs}}
            = \underbrace{x \cdot...\cdot x}_{a\text{ pcs}} \cdot
              \underbrace{x \cdot...\cdot x}_{b\text{ pcs}}
            = x^a x^b

math:
   (x^a)^b = \underbrace{\overbrace{x^a}^{x\cdot...\cdot x,\ a\text{ pcs}}
              \cdot\ \ x^a\ \cdot ... \cdot x^a}_{b\text{ pcs}}
           = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot...\cdot x}_{a\cdot b\ \text{pcs}}
           = x^{ab}

math: x^0 = 1

math: \sqrt x = x^\frac 1 2

math: \sqrt a \sqrt b = \sqrt{ab}

math: (\sqrt x\ )^2 = x

math: \sqrt{x^2} = |x|

If you're wondering why anything to the power of 0 is 1, you can do e.g.
$x^2 = x^{0+2} = x^0 x^2$. The equation should be true with any $x$, so
$x^0$ must be 1 because $x^2 = 1 x^2$.

It's easiest to think of $\sqrt x$ as the non-negative number that is $x$ when
multiplied with itself. For example, 3 is not negative, so $\sqrt 9 = 3$
because $3 \cdot 3 = 9$. Similarly e.g. $\sqrt 4 = 2$, $\sqrt 1 = 1$ and
$\sqrt 0 = 0$. No number produces a negative number when multiplied with
itself, so you cannot do $\sqrt{-2}$ (unless you use complex numbers, but they
are beyond the scope of this tutorial).

You're probably wondering how the heck our $\sqrt{x^2}=|x|$ rule works. This
example should explain everything:

math: \sqrt{(-3)^2}=\sqrt{(-3)(-3)}=\sqrt{-(-(3 \cdot 3))}=\sqrt{3 \cdot 3}=\sqrt{3^2}


## Functions

Here's a typical math function:

math:
   f(x) &= 2x \\
   f(6) &= 2 \cdot 6 = 12

There is no special syntax for defining a function. All we have is the
equal sign, and when defining a function we just say that its value at x is
equal to something.

If you're familiar with a functional programming language like Haskell, then
you'll probably realize that the above math looks a lot like this Haskell
session:

code: haskell
   Prelude> let f x = 2*x
   Prelude> f 6
   12
   Prelude>

If you're feeling like WTF is this, here's a Python session that should make
everything clear.

code: python3
   >>> def f(x):
   ...     return 2*x
   ...
   >>> f(6)
   12

Quick note about ``f(x)`` versus ``f x``: if you define your own function
called $f$ or $g$ you should use $f(x)$, but you can do e.g. $\sin x$ or
$\cos x$ with some "special" functions for historical reasons.


## Equations

For example, if you know that $2x+1 = 9$ you can find $x$ like this:

math:
    2x+1 &= 9 \\
    2x &= 8 \\
    x &= 4

The idea here is that if $2x+1=9$ then $(2x+1)-1=9-1$; that is, $2x=8$. So you
can do pretty much anything to both sides of the $=$ and the equality will
still work. I started by substracting 1 from both sides and then I divided
everything by 2.

Normal limitations apply here; for example, if you have $2x=3x$ and you divide
by $x$ you get $2=3$ and it seems like no $x$ can satisfy the equation.
However, you cannot divide by $0$ and turns out that $x=0$ is a valid solution
because $2 \cdot 0 = 0$ and $3 \cdot 0 = 0$.

You can also apply most functions to both sides. For example, you can do this
with $\sqrt{\ \ }$:

math:
    x^2 =& 4 \\
    \sqrt{x^2} =& \sqrt 4 \\
    |x| =& 2 \\
    x=2 \text{ or}&\text{ } x=-2
