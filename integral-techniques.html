<h1 id="integration-techniques">Integration Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-techniques" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><div class="box redbox"><p>This chapter assumes that you know <a href="integrals.html">integrals</a> and
<a href="more-geometry-and-trig.html#derivative-of-sine">sine and cosine
derivatives</a>.
</p>

</div><p>Nowadays it's easiest to use sympy for doing difficult integrals, but in this
chapter we'll look into how integrals were done before computers and
calculators. It sounds very boring and hard, but you might find especially
u-substitution kind of amazing.</p>

<h2 id="u-substitution">U Substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#u-substitution" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>In the integral chapter we learned that $\int f(x)\ dx$ means the
antiderivatives of $f$. The notation with $dx$'s in it is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>'s notation,
and I explained the $\int f(x)\ dx$ like Leibniz did. However, the notation
probably wouldn't be used today if the trick I'm about to show wouldn't make it
really handy.</p>

<p>Let's say that $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$; that is, $F'(x)=f(x)$. In the
integral chapter we turned the <a href="derivatives.html#chain-rule">chain rule</a>
into an integral rule by integrating both sides:</p>

$$\begin{align}f(g(x))g'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}F(g(x)) \\
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\ dx &= F(g(x)) + C\end{align}$$<p>Something interesting happens if we define another variable $u=g(x)$. Then
$\frac{du}{dx}=g'(x)$.</p>

$$\begin{align}\int f(u)\frac{du}{dx}\ dx &= F(u) + C\end{align}$$<p>Could we just <i>cancel out</i> the $dx$'s? It feels kind of wrong because the $dx$
is just a part of our antiderivative notation and not really a variable, but
let's try it and see what happens:</p>

$$\begin{align}\int f(u)\frac{du}{\rcancel{dx}}\rcancel{dx} &\mathop{=}^{\text{wat}} F(u) + C \\
\int f(u)\ du\ &\mathop{=}^{\text{lol}}_{\text{srsly?}}\ F(u) + C\end{align}$$<p>Amazing, it really worked! $F(u) + C$ is indeed the integral of $f(u)$ with
respect to $u$.</p>

$$\begin{align}\frac{d}{du}(F(u)+C) \mathop{=}^{\text{yes}} F'(u)+0 \mathop{=}_{\text{srsly}} f(u)\end{align}$$<p>When our teacher had shown this trick to us for the first time, everyone were
just amazed by it, and the teacher said that he wanted to take a picture of our
faces.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><h2> Example: $\int x\sin(x^2)\ dx$</h2><p>The derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$ and it differs from $x$ by just a constant,
so a substitution like $u=x^2$ will work.</p>

$$\begin{align}\int x\sin(x^2)\ dx &= \int \sin(\green{x^2})\ \blue{x\ dx}  \qquad\qquad \begin{array}{l}      \green u = \green{x^2} \\
    \frac{du}{dx} = 2x \\
    du = 2x\ dx \\
    \blue{x\ dx} = \blue{\frac 1 2 du} \\
\end{array} \\
&= \int\sin(\green u)\blue{\frac 1 2 du} \\
&= \frac 1 2 \int\sin(u)\ du \\
&= \frac 1 2 (-\cos(\green u)) + C \\
&= -\frac 1 2 \cos(\green{x^2}) + C\end{align}$$$$\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx}\left(-\frac 1 2 \cos(x^2) + C\right)  = -\frac 1 2 (-\sin(x^2)) \cdot 2x + 0 = x\sin(x^2)\end{align}$$</div><p>This worked because it's easy to change the integral so that it contains
the derivative of the inside:</p>

$$\begin{align}\int x\sin(x^2)\ dx = \frac 1 2 \int 2x\sin(x^2)\ dx\end{align}$$<p>Treating $du$ and $dx$ as variables like $du=2x\ dx$ is hand-wavy, but it's
very commonly used and accepted hand-waviness because it works so nicely. In
fact, many people write $\int dx$ when they mean $\int 1\ dx$ and
$\int \frac{dx}{f(x)}$ when they mean $\int \frac{1}{f(x)}\ dx$.</p>

<p>Note that in the above example we added another variable, and switched
<b>everything</b> to use that variable instead of $x$; there must be no $x$ left
over. If there is, try another $u$ choice, do something to the function before
integrating it or maybe try some other integration technique instead of $u$
substitution. When we were done, we went from the $u$ world back to the $x$
world.</p>

<div id="story" class="box graybox"><h2> Exercise</h2><p>Here's a true story. At school we had trouble with this integral:</p>

$$\begin{align}\int \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}\ dx\end{align}$$<p>Our supply teacher came up with a solution, and when I saw it I knew it was
very incorrect, aka <b>WRONG</b> in <b>CAPS AND BOLD</b>. It started like this:</p>

$$\begin{align}\int \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}  = \frac{1}{2\sin(x)}\int\frac{2\sin(x)\cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}\ dx =\ ...\end{align}$$<p>Here the supply teacher wanted to have the derivative of $\sin^2(x)$ on the
top. You should know by now that we <b>cannot</b> bring non-constants like
$\frac{1}{2\sin(x)}$ out of integrals. I argued with the teacher about his
solution for the rest of the lesson, and the following day our actual
teacher thanked me for arguing about it. Later I found two more fatal
mistakes from the solution.</p>

<p>Anyway, integrate $\dfrac{\cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}$ correctly. It's easy with
the correct substitution. (Note that
<a href="explog.html#exponent-functions">$x^{-a} = 1/x^a$</a>.)
</p>

</div><p>Let's see how this works for definite integral; that is, $\int_a^b$ instead of
$\int$, area instead of antiderivative.</p>

$$\begin{align}\int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x)\ dx &= \bigl[F(g(x))\bigr]_{x=a}^{x=b} \\
&= F(\green{g(b)})-F(\green{g(a)}) \\
&= \bigl[F(\green{u})\bigr]_{u=\green{g(a)}}^{u=\green{g(b)}} \\
&= \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)\ du\end{align}$$<p>This means that we just need to change the limits to $u$ values.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><h2> Example: $\int_\sqrt{\tau}^\sqrt{2\tau} x\sin(x^2)\ dx$</h2>$$\begin{align}\int_\sqrt{\tau}^\sqrt{2\tau} x\sin(x^2)\ dx &= \int_\sqrt{\tau}^\sqrt{2\tau} \sin(x^2)\ x\ dx  \qquad\qquad \begin{array}{l}      u = x^2 \\
    \text{if }x=\sqrt{\tau}\text{ then }u=\tau \\
    \text{if }x=\sqrt{2\tau}\text{ then }u=2\tau \\
    du = 2x\ dx \\
    x\ dx = \frac 1 2 du \\
\end{array} \\
&= \int_\tau^{2\tau}\sin(u)\frac 1 2 du \\
&= \frac 1 2 \bigl[-\cos(u)\bigr]_{u=\tau}^{u=2\tau} \\
&= \frac 1 2 (-\cos(2\tau)-(-\cos(\tau))) \\
&= \frac 1 2 (\green{\cos(\tau)-\cos(2\tau)})\end{align}$$<p>$\tau$ and $2\tau$ differ from each other by a full turn, and rotating a
full turn on the unit circle brings us back to where we started and the
cosines are the same.</p>

$$\begin{align}\cos(\tau) &= \cos(2\tau) \\
\green{\cos(\tau)-\cos(2\tau)} &= 0 \\
\int_\sqrt{\tau}^\sqrt{2\tau} x\sin(x^2)\ dx &= 0\end{align}$$</div><p>Note that we didn't need to go back to the $x$ world; with definite integrals
it's enough to change the limits, and then we can forget the whole $x$.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><h2> Exercise</h2><p>The <a href="graphs.html#parabolas">parabola</a> $y=(x-1)^2$ rotates around the $x$
axis between $0 \le x \le 2$. Calculate the volume of the shape it forms.</p>
