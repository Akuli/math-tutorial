# Images drawn with Asymptote

The images in this directory are drawn with
[Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/). If you add an image named
`wat.asy` here, just refer to it as `asy/wat.png` from rst files;
[conf.py](../conf.py) generates and removes the png file automagically when
building.
