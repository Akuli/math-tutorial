<p>Infinity
========</p>

<p>Infinity is a number that seems sort of mystical.</p>

<p>It is <b>the</b> biggest number. There isn't any number bigger than it, by
definition. But is it really a number?</p>

<p>Let's try assuming infinity <b>is</b> a number and let's also try some operations
on it.</p>

<p>First off, the most basic of operations. Adding. If I have 2 ducks, and you
have 3 ducks, and we join them together, we now have 5 ducks. We can count
those ducks one by one. That's why 2 + 3 = 5.</p>

<p>But the idea starts to break apart once we put in infinity. If I have inf ducks,
and you still have 3 ducks, we can still join them together and start
counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., inf. There's still infinity ducks, adding 3 ducks
does nothing. So we can say inf + 3 = inf.</p>

<p>We could just run with it and go on, but you can see how this already creates
problems. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```
Let's start with this equation.
inf + 2 = inf</p>

<p>Then, we add 3 to both sides.
inf + 2 + 3 = inf + 3
inf + 5 = inf + 3</p>

<p>We can now subtract inf from both sides.
5 = 3
```</p>

<p>What just happened there? 5 is <i>obviously</i> not equal to 3. So something is
obviously wrong. Either <b>all</b> of math is wrong and 5 <b>is</b> equal to 3, or
our assumption is wrong.</p>

<p>It isn't looking good for our assumption, so that means infinity is not really
a number. It's more of an idea, a concept. You can say something is "infinite",
as in "there are infinite numbers", or maybe "the universe is (maybe) infinite",
but you can't just plug infinity into formulas.</p>

<p>Limits
======</p>

<p>This is why some really smart people invented what's known as "limits".</p>

<p>A limit basically says "hey, I know infinity isn't <i>really</i> a number, but what
happens if I get really really close?"</p>

<p>For example, euler's number, commonly known as e. Its definition is the
following:</p>

<p>```
e = lim n -> inf (1 + 1/n)^n
```</p>

<p>Now let's try just naively plugging in infinity as n.</p>

<p>```
e = (1 + 1/inf)^inf</p>

<p>We can think of 1/inf as being zero, since dividing something to <i>infinite</i>
people would cause each person to get basically nothing.
e = (1 + 0)^inf
e = 1^inf</p>

<p>Now what might 1^inf be? We know that 1 to the power of anything is 1, so let's
just say it's 1.
e = 1
```</p>

<p>As some of you may know, e <i>is not</i> 1. It's about 2.718. So how did those smart
people get that value?</p>

<p>They did so by not plugging in infinity itself, but by plugging in bigger and
bigger values of n. Here's a table that shows what happens as you make n bigger
and bigger.</p>

<p>|n|e|
|-----|
|1|2.0|
|12|2.613035290224676|
|52|2.692596954437168|
|365|2.7145674820219727|
|100000|2.7182682371922975|</p>

<p>You can see that slowly and slowly as we build up bigger and bigger values of n
it's getting nearer to some specific value.</p>

<p>Maths people call this "approaching", basically getting nearer and nearer a
value, but never touching it, because actually touching that value would
require getting to infinity, which as we know is impossible if we just plug in
larger and larger values of n. We'll never run out of numbers and say "okay now
this is infinity".</p>

<p>You can see how this demostrates that limits aren't just plugging in infinity
into our formula, or just one really big value, but increasing and increasing
values until we can say "okay, if we keep going on this is what we'll get."</p>

<p>To really understand this, you can try it with other limits.
The notion of "getting closer" is still there, even if what's after the arrow
isn't infinity. If we have `n -> 1`, we would plug in values such as 0.1, then
0.2, then 0.5, 0.9, 0.999999999, etc... but never exactly 1.</p>

<p>Here's a fun limit I like:</p>

<p>```
lim n -> 1 (((n*n) - 1) / (n - 1))
```
