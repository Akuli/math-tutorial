<h1 id="physics-stuff">Physics Stuff<a class="headerlink" href="#physics-stuff" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><p>This is mostly a math tutorial, but the math is not useless or isolated from
the real world in any way. In this chapter we'll look into a bunch of ways to
use math things for calculating more concrete stuff in the real world.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>This chapter assumes that you know <a href="derivatives.html">derivatives</a>.</p>

<p>There are also a few <a href="integrals.html">integrals</a>, but all you need to know
is that $\int f(x)\ dx$ means all antiderivatives of $f$. For example,
$\int 2x\ dx = x^2 + C$ because $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+C)=2x$, and in fact, all
antiderivatives are $x^2+$ some constant and that's what the $C$ is doing.
</p>

</div><p>I'll use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI units</a>
in this chapter, so instead of feet and pounds there will be metres and
kilograms. If you live in a country that doesn't use SI units much, have a look
at this table:</p>

<p><table>
<tr><th>Name of SI unit</th><th>Example value</th><th>Example value in non-SI units<sup>*</sup></th></tr>
<tr><td>kilogram</td><td>80 kg</td><td>180 lbs</td></tr>
<tr><td>metre</td><td>9.81 m</td><td>32 feet</td></tr>
<tr><td>centimetre, $1\rm{cm}=\frac{1}{100}\rm{m}$</td><td>10 cm</td><td>4 inches</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h2 id="basic-stuff">Basic Stuff<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-stuff" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Here's a list of things I'll use in this tutorial:</p>

<ul><li>Mass is usually denoted with $m$, and it's in kilograms.
</li></ul><ul><li>Time is almost always denoted with $t$ and measured with seconds.
</li></ul><ul><li>Distances are often denoted with e.g. $x$ or $y$. The SI unit of distances is
  metre.
</li></ul><ul><li>Velocity means how fast you are moving; in other words, it's the derivative
  of your location with respect to time:
</li></ul><div class="indent">$$\begin{align}v = \frac{dx}{dt}\end{align}$$<p>The unit of velocity is $\rm{m}/\rm{s}$ because $dx$ is conceptually a tiny
distance (metres) and $dt$ is a tiny time interval (seconds).
</p>

</div><ul><li>Acceleration is the changing rate of the velocity. If it's positive, your
  velocity is getting bigger.
</li></ul><div class="indent">$$\begin{align}a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\end{align}$$<p>The $d^2$ notation means the derivative of the derivative of $x$; we take
the derivative two times. It "works" like this:</p>

$$\begin{align}a = \frac{d\frac{dx}{dt}}{dt}  \mathop{=}^{\red ?}\frac{d \cdot dx}{dt \cdot dt}  \mathop{=}^{\red ?}\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\end{align}$$<p>This makes no sense because $dx$ doesn't mean $d$ times $x$; it means the
change of $x$. However, it's just notation, and the
$\frac{d}{dt}x = \frac{dx}{dt}$ we are more used to doesn't make sense
either.</p>

<p>It can be handy to think of $x$, $v$ and $a$ as functions of the time and
write $x(t)$ instead of plain $x$, and this lets us use the usual $'$
notation:</p>

$$\begin{align}v(t) &= x'(t) \\
a(t) &= x''(t)\end{align}$$<p>Velocity is metres per second, so acceleration is metres per second per
second, or $\frac{\rm{m}/\rm{s}}{\rm s} = \rm{m}/\rm{s}^2$. For example,
$2\rm m/\rm{s}^2=\frac{2\rm m/\rm s}{\rm s}$ means that the velocity
increases by $2\rm m/\rm s$ every second.
</p>

</div><p>This is already enough stuff for calculating something fun.</p>

<h2 id="example-feather-and-hammer">Example: Feather and Hammer<a class="headerlink" href="#example-feather-and-hammer" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Here's a famous
experiment:</p>

<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5C5_dOEyAfk"></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see, the acceleration caused by gravity does not depend on the mass
or shape of the object, and we can really see it if there's no air resistance.
Let's try to calculate what that acceleration is.</p>

<p>Let's call the acceleration $g$ like gravity. It's a constant, so we can find
the speed $v(t)$ easily. We'll choose this so that positive $v$ means going
down; this way we can work with positive numbers and keep everything nice and
simple.</p>

$$\begin{align}v(t) = \int g\ dt = gt+C_1\end{align}$$<p>At $t=0$ the hammer and feather were just about to be dropped, and their
velocity was still $0$:</p>

$$\begin{align}v(0) &= 0 \\
g \cdot 0 + C_1 &= 0 \\
C_1 &= 0 \\
v(t) &= gt\end{align}$$<p>We can integrate again to find the height at time $t$. Let's call that $y(t)$
so that more $y$ means down.</p>

$$\begin{align}y(t) &= \int v(t)\ dt = \int gt\ dt = \frac 1 2 gt^2 + C_2\end{align}$$<p>The initial height of the objects seems to be about $1.5\rm m$, and dropping
them took about one second:</p>

$$\begin{align}y(1\rm s)-y(0\rm s) &= 1.5\rm m \\
\Bigl(\frac 1 2 g(1\rm s)^2 \rcancel{+ C_2}\Bigr) - \Bigl(\frac 1 2 g\cdot0^2 \rcancel{+ C_2}\Bigr) &= 1.5 \rm m \\
\frac 1 2 g(1\rm s)^2 &= 1.5 \rm m \\
g &= 2 \cdot \frac{1.5 \rm m}{(1\rm s)^2} = 3 \rm m/\rm{s}^2\end{align}$$<p>A quick search for "moon gravity" gives $1.625 \rm m/\rm{s}^2$, and our thing
is horribly wrong. I haven't figured out what goes wrong with it yet.</p>

<h2 id="newton-s-second-law">Newton's Second Law<a class="headerlink" href="#newton-s-second-law" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Here's Newton's second law, written in a mathy way:</p>

$$\begin{align}\Sigma F = ma\end{align}$$<p>Here $\Sigma$ means sum, and $\Sigma F$ is the sum of all forces that are
pushing a mass and causing it an acceleration. In our previous example, there
was only one force, the gravity $G$:</p>

$$\begin{align}\green{\Sigma F} = m\blue{a} \\
\green{G} = m\blue{g}\end{align}$$<p>In fact, the force caused by gravity is always $mg$. For example, let's
calculate the force that gravity pulls a person of weight 80kg down at:</p>

$$\begin{align}G = mg = 80\rm{kg} \cdot 9.81\rm m/\rm{s}^2 \approx 784\rm{kgm}/\rm{s}^2 = 784 \rm N\end{align}$$<p>Here the $\rm N$ unit is 1 newton, defined so that
$1\rm N = \frac{1\rm{kg} \cdot 1\rm m}{(1\rm s)^2}$.</p>

<p>If you're sitting in front of your computer, gravity is pulling you down, but
your acceleration is zero because you don't fall through your chair. Let's
figure out why:</p>

$$\begin{align}\Sigma F = ma = m \cdot 0 = 0\end{align}$$<p>This means that $\Sigma F \ne G$ because $G \ne 0$; instead $\Sigma F = G + M$
where $M$ is some kind of Mystery force that we'll try to explain.</p>

$$\begin{align}\Sigma F &= 0 \\
G + M &= 0 \\
M &= -G\end{align}$$<p>This mystery force is your chair holding up your butt, and it has a minus sign
in the front because it goes to the opposite direction compared to gravity.
That's why they cancel out nicely and you don't accelerate anywhere.</p>

<p>Newton's first and third law are closely related to Newton's second law. For
example, the first law is a special case of the second law: it says that a mass
stays in place or moves smoothly ($a=0$) if no forces apply to it
($\Sigma F = 0$).
