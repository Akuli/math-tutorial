# Derivatives

Derivatives are one of my favorite things in math. At first they seem
like calculating their values will be quite complicated, but it turns
out to be surprisingly easy.

Derivatives are also not useless gibberish isolated from real life. There's a
practical demonstration game at the end of the chapter, and we can do all kinds
of amazing other stuff with derivatives.

redbox:
    This chapter assumes that you know what limits are. If you have never heard
    of them before, I highly recommend reading [the limit section in the
    infinity chapter](infinity.html#limits) first.

## Slopes

The equation of any (non-vertical) line is of the form $y=sx+c$ where $s$
is the slope and $c$ is a constant. If you have no idea what that means, use
this awesome demo thing that [a friend of mine](https://github.com/PurpleMyst/)
made to see how changing the constant and the slope affects the line. The
equation of the line is shown in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> in the
top left corner.

<iframe src="https://purplemyst.github.io/generic-graphing/line.html"
        width="350" height="400"></iframe>

The $c$ constant specifies how high the line is. It's important to note what
happens to the line as you change the slope; the bigger the slope, the steeper
the line goes up, and a negative slope means that the line goes down instead.
You can think of slope as some kind of **growth rate**.

A *difference* means how much a value changes. For example, if the value of $x$
is first 5 and then we change it to 6, $x$ changes by $\Delta x = 1$. Here
$\Delta$ is the Greek delta letter, so if someone's code has a variable named
``deltax`` it means this.

Now choose two points from the line and imagine drawing a triangle between
those points. Let's call the height of this triangle $\Delta y$ and the width
$\Delta x$. Like this:

asymptote:
    size(14cm);
    grid(-1,5,-2,9);

    axises(-1,5,-2,9);
    // TODO: move this shit to axises()?
    for (real x = 1; x <= 4; x += 1)
       draw((x,0)--(x,0), L=(string) x, align=S);
    for (real y = 1; y <= 7; y += 1)
       draw((0,y)--(0,y), L=(string) y, align=W);

    real f(real x) { return 2*x + 1; }
    draw(graph(f,-1,4), blue,
         L=Label(rrotate(atan(2))*"$y=2x+1$", position=Relative(0.85)), align=W);

    real x1=0, x2=3;
    dot((x1,f(x1)), dotpen);
    dot((x2,f(x2)), dotpen);
    draw((x1,f(x1))--(x2,f(x1)), L="$\Delta x$", align=N);
    draw((x2,f(x1))--(x2,f(x2)), L="$\Delta y$", align=E);

In this example I have set the constant term to 1 and slope to 2, and with
these points, I get $\Delta y = 6$ and $\Delta x = 3$. Here's something
interesting:

math:
    \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac 6 3 = 2

This is the slope. You can always find the slope by drawing a triangle like
this and then calculating $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. Just to convince
yourself, choose another pair of points and try it again; you still get the
same slope.

## What is a derivative?

Now we know what slopes of lines are and how to calculate them, but can we
calculate slopes of curves that look e.g. like this?

asymptote:
    size(10cm);
    real xminmax = 2;
    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    axises(-xminmax-0.5, xminmax+0.5, -0.5, f(xminmax));
    draw(graph(f, -xminmax, xminmax), blue);
    label((1,f(1)), blue, L=rotate(65)*"$y=x^2$", align=E);
    for (real x = -xminmax; x <= xminmax; ++x) {
        if (x != 0) {
            dot((x,0), p=dotpen, L=(string)x, align=S);
        }
    }
    for (real y = 1; y < f(xminmax); ++y) {
        dot((0,y), p=dotpen, L=(string)y, align=W);
    }

The problem with this is that we don't get the same $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
ratios everywhere. You can think about $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ as the
growth rate, and as you can see in the above graph, the values of $x^2$ grow at
different rates in different places. For example, the slope seems to be $0$ at
$x=0$ and something positive when $x$ is positive.

Maybe we could calculate the slope with a very small triangle?

asymptote:
    size(10cm);
    real xminmax = 1;
    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    axises(-0.5, xminmax+0.5, -0.5, f(xminmax));
    draw(graph(f, -0.5, xminmax), blue);
    label((1,f(1)), blue, L=rotate(65)*"$y=x^2$", align=E);
    dot((1,0), p=dotpen, L="1", align=S);

    real x1=0.6, x2=0.75;
    draw((x1,f(x1))--(x2,f(x1)), L="$\Delta x$", align=S);
    draw((x2,f(x1))--(x2,f(x2)), L="$\Delta y$", align=E);

We can calculate the exact slope at a point with a limit like
$\displaystyle\lim_{\Delta x\to0} \textstyle\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. This
limit is known as the **derivative**.

Let's find a formula for calculating derivatives. We'll do this for a general
$y=f(x)$ graph instead of $y=x^2$, so we'll get something that is not limited
to just $x^2$.

asymptote:
    size(12cm);
    real xmin = 0.1, xmax=1.7;
    real f(real x) { return 1.5*sin(x); }
    axises(xmin, xmax+0.5, 0, 0);
    draw(graph(f, xmin, xmax), heavyred);
    label((xmax-0.3,f(xmax-0.3)), heavyred, L=rotate(10)*"$y=f(x)$", align=N);

    real x1=0.8, x2=1.2;
    draw((x1,0)--(x1,f(x1)), smalldashes+lightblue);
    draw((x2,0)--(x2,f(x1)), smalldashes+lightblue);
    draw((x1,f(x1))--(x2,f(x1)), L="$\Delta x$", align=S);
    draw((x2,f(x1))--(x2,f(x2)), L="$\Delta y$", align=W);
    dot((x2,0), p=dotpen, L="$x+\Delta x$", align=S);
    dot((x1,0), p=dotpen, L="$x$", align=S);
    draw(brace((x1-0.05,0), (x1-0.05,f(x1))), L="$f(x)$", align=W);
    draw(brace((x2+0.05,f(x2)), (x2+0.05,0)), L="$f(x+\Delta x)$", align=E);

There are quite a few things going on in the above drawing. Make sure that you
fully understand it before moving on.

If we look at the length of the $f(x+\Delta x)$ line and take off the length of
the $f(x)$ line, we're left with $\Delta y$. So $f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)=\Delta y$.
Let's plug this into our definition of derivative:

math:
    \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \
    = \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}

Finally we'll replace $\Delta x$ with $h$ just to make this formula less
annoying to use. This is especially true for writing by hand because we can't
just copy/paste $\Delta x$ everywhere.

math:
    \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}

floatingbox: Handy thing: $(x+h)^2=x^2+2xh+h^2$
    Proof:

    math:
        & \ (x+h)^2
        =&\ (x+h)(x+h)
        =&\ (x+h)x+(x+h)h
        =&\ xx+hx+xh+hh
        =&\ x^2+2xh+h^2

Now we can set $f(x)=x^2$ and see what we get.

math:
    \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{(2x+h)h}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} (2x+h)
    &= 2x

asymptote: float:right;
   size(10cm);
   axises(-3,6,-1,20);

   // this is drawn first so it goes below the x^2 line
   real tangent(real x) {
       return 4*x-4;
   }
   draw((0.8,tangent(0.8))--(6,tangent(6)), p=darkorange,
        L=rotate(degrees(atan(4)))*Label("this thing's slope is 4", position=Relative(0.6)));

   real square(real x) { return x**2; }
   draw(graph(square, -3,4.5), blue, L=rotate(75)*"$y = x^2$", align=NW);

   draw((2,0)--(2,2**2), smalldashes);
   label("2", (2,0), align=S);

I think this is cool. We started with a complicated-looking thing but finally
we arrived at just $2x$. What's more, the $2x$ is not just a random value we
got out of a spooky calculation; for example, at $x=2$ the derivative is
$2 \cdot 2 = 4$, so if we draw a straight line that barely touches $y=x^2$ at
$x=2$ its slope will also be 4 like in the image at right.

Earlier we looked at the line $y=2x+1$ and we got the slope 2 from any
$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ ratio, but derivatives are
$\displaystyle\lim_{\Delta x\to0} \textstyle\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, so the
derivative of $2x+1$ should be 2. Let's see if that works:

math: y = f(x) = 2x+1

math:
    \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{(2(x+h)+1)-(2x+1)}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{2(x+h)+1-2x-1}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{2x+2h+1-2x-1}{h}
    &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{2h}{h}
    &= 2

Note how $x$ disappeared: the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$, but the derivative
of $2x+1$ is $2$ without any $x$. In other words, the derivative of $2x+1$ is
the same with any $x$ value. This makes sense because straight lines have the
same slope everywhere.

In fact, if you are asked to find the derivative of something like $5x+8$ you
know immediately that's 5 because $y=5x+8$ is a straight line with slope 5.

graybox:
    The derivative $\displaystyle\lim_{\Delta x\to0} \textstyle\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
    is often written as $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Historically $dy$ and $dx$ were
    infinitely tiny changes of $y$ and $x$, but nowadays limits are
    preferred over "infinitely small numbers".

    It's also common to write $\frac{d}{dx} y$ instead of $\frac{dy}{dx}$,
    although it doesn't make much sense because $dy$ doesn't mean $d$ times $y$.
    Another common style is to put a single quote after a function name, like
    $f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f(x)$.

    Sometimes programmers write ``dy`` when they really mean ``deltay``.
    It doesn't make sense either, but ``dy`` is much less typing than
    ``deltay``.

graybox: Exercise
    Prove that the derivative of $sx+c$ is always $s$ by plugging in
    $f(x)=sx+c$ to the definition of derivative. Here $s$ and $c$ are
    constants.

## Faster!

Let's say that you want to calculate something like this:

math:
    \frac{d}{dx} (6x^2+7x-123)

That would be a horribly complicated calculation with the definition of
derivative. In these cases, we can use some handy-dandy rules:

* If we have a bunch of things added or substracted from each other we can find
  the derivatives of each thing one by one. We'll prove this in [the next
  chapter](more-derivatives.html).

math:
    \frac{d}{dx} (6x^2+7x-123) = \frac{d}{dx}(6x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(7x) - \frac{d}{dx}(123)

* You can move constants to the front of the $\frac{d}{dx}$. This works only
  with constants; you cannot move anything with $x$ in it to the front. Again,
  there's a proof in the next chapter.

math:
    \frac{d}{dx}(6x^2) = 6 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)

* Derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$. We proved this in our very first derivative
  example.

math:
    \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x

* The derivative of $x$ is 1 because the slope of the line $y=x$ is 1. You can
  also check this by plugging in $f(x)=x$ to the definition of derivative.

math:
    \frac{d}{dx} x = 1

* The derivative of any constant (e.g. 3) is 0 because a line like $y=3$ is
  horizontal and it has slope 0. Again, you can check with the definition of
  derivative.

math:
    \frac{d}{dx} 3 = 0

That's quite a few rules, but they make this handy:

math:
    &  \frac{d}{dx} (6x^2+7x-123)
    =& \frac{d}{dx}(6x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(7x) - \frac{d}{dx}(123)
    =& 6 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + 7 \cdot \frac{d}{dx} x - 0
    =& 6 \cdot 2x + 7 \cdot 1
    =& 12x + 7

graybox: See Also
    The summary page has a derivative section with [many more
    rules](summary.html#derivative-rules). You may need them if you want
    to find derivatives of different functions than the functions in
    this chapter.

You can also use a nice symbolic calculation library, like Python's
[sympy](http://www.sympy.org) (can be installed with pip):

code: python3
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> init_printing()
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> diff(x**2, x)
    2⋅x
    >>> diff(6 * x**2 + 7*x - 123, x)
    12⋅x + 7

Here "diff" is short for "differentiate", and it means finding a derivative.

## Some History

[Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) and
[Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) discovered
this derivative stuff independently in the mid-17th century, and they didn't
exactly agree about which of them had invented it first.

The word "derivative" probably refers to how it can be easily *derived* for
most functions like in the example above, but other explanations exist too:

## Example: Smooth Jumps

Let's say you're making a game where a player can jump over something. If the
player moves right at a steady speed, which of these jumps looks best?

asymptote:
   size(20cm);

   draw((0,0)--(0,1)--(1,1)--(1,0.5), smalldashes);
   dot((1,0.5));

   draw((1.5,0)--(1.5 + 2/3, 1)--(2.5,0.5), smalldashes);
   dot((2.5,0.5));

   real f(real x) {
       /* top of parabola should be between x=3.7 and x=4, calculations with x=4:
         f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
         f'(x) = 2ax + b
         f'(3.7) = 0
         2*a*3.7 + b = 0
         -a approx 7.5 b
       i found the constant with trial and error
       */
       return -2x**2 + 15*x - 27.2;
   }

    draw(graph(f, 3, 4.2), smalldashes);
   dot((4.2, f(4.2)));

The answer is obvious -- the rightmost jump looks best. It's time to figure out
how to make games with jumps like that.

Let's say that $t$ is time and $h$ is the height of our player, so we get this
graph:

asymptote:
   size(9cm);
   axises(-0.3, 3.5, -0.4, 2, "$t$", "$h$");

   real f(real x) { return -x**2 + 3*x - 0.5; }
   draw(graph(f, 0, 3));

[This graph looks like a parabola, so its equation is $h=at^2+bt+c$
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants.](graphs.html#parabolas) The
changing rate of height is the falling speed. Let's call that $v$ like
velocity.

math: v = \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (at^2+bt+c) = 2at+b

On the other hand, the changing rate of velocity is the acceleration caused by
gravity. Let's call that $g$.

math: g = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (2at+b) = 2a

Note how the $t$ disappeared and we're left with just the constant $2a$. This
makes sense because the gravity is always the same, no matter what time it is.

This Python program...

code: python3
   height = 0
   velocity = 10
   gravity = 2

   while height >= 0:
       print(' '*height + 'O')
       height += velocity
       velocity -= gravity

...prints this awesome parabola:

code:
   O
             O
                     O
                           O
                               O
                                 O
                                 O
                               O
                           O
                     O
             O
   O

You can use similar code for doing jumps in games. Here's a demo created with
my canvaswrapper.js script. Click it and use arrow keys to move the ball.

canvasdemo:
   const GRAVITY = 1.5;
   var ball = {
     x: screen.width/2,    // centered
     height: 0,            // distance from bottom of screen to ball's bottom
     velocity: 0,          // positive means up
     velocityMax: 30,      // velocity immediately after a jump
     sidewayMovement: 0,   // -1 is left, +1 right
     sidewaySpeed: 10,
     radius: 30,
   };


   runRepeatedly(function() {
     screen.fill('black');
     screen.drawCircle(ball.x, screen.height-ball.height-ball.radius,
                       ball.radius, 'white');

     ball.x += ball.sidewayMovement * ball.sidewaySpeed;
     ball.height += ball.velocity;
     ball.velocity -= GRAVITY;

     if (ball.height < 0) {
       // ball hits the ground
       ball.height = 0;
       ball.velocity = 0;
     }

     screen.getEvents().forEach(evt => {
       if (evt.type == 'keydown') {
         if (evt.key == 'ArrowLeft') {
           ball.sidewayMovement = -1;
         } else if (evt.key == 'ArrowRight') {
           ball.sidewayMovement = 1;
         } else if (evt.key == 'ArrowUp') {
           ball.velocity = ball.velocityMax;
         }
       } else if (evt.type == 'keyup' && (
             (evt.key == 'ArrowLeft' && ball.sidewayMovement == -1) ||
             (evt.key == 'ArrowRight' && ball.sidewayMovement == 1))) {
         // cancel the previous ArrowLeft or ArrowRight press
         ball.sidewayMovement = 0;
       }
     });
   });
